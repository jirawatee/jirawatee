## About me
I am a software developer with over 10 years of experience. I currently work at LINE Thailand, as a Technology Evangelist. Since discovering Firebase, I have spent most of my time learning about Firebase.

I live in Bangkok, Thailand where I am actively involved in the local Firebase community such as speaking at conferences, writing blog posts and creating code samples all over Thailand. I also founded the largest Thailand Firebase developer group with over 10,000 members.

My passion is to help developers learn and adopt new mobile development methodologies and frameworks like Firebase.

While I am not developing, I like to spend time with my wife and child.
